# WeatherCharm
This is one of my first original Python apps.
I created it as an exercise, trying to recap everything I learned so far.
It uses for loops, several functions created by me, if statements, API calls, modules such as datetime, time, Tkinter, and OOP.

The data is provided by the MeteoRomania API, and also by OpenWeatherMap API.
